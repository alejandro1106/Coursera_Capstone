    "A strategy to fight against crime is to create a police station where different situations can be attended such as receive reports of crimes suffered by neighbors and prosecute criminals more efficiently. Also, policemen can get out from the station to patrol the neighborhood. The decision about where to place the new police station must be based on crimes rates in the city, due to the neighborhood with the highest crimes rate is a priority to counter crimes."
